  <p>The routes module is automatically generated from the <code>routes.json</code> file
found in the <code>config</code> directory in your applications project root. It defines
a series of uniquely named routes that the data service will use to resolve
calls from application code. Since the data service acts very much like a
software router, this file can be considered the heart of the data service&#39;s
ability to correctly identify which route to select and resolve calls from
based on the application <a href="/#/api/blt_appProfile">profile</a> specifications.</p>
<h2 id="creating-routes">Creating Routes</h2>
<p>Create a routes file is as simple as creating a new, specially named JSON file -
<code>routes.json</code> - in the &#39;config&#39; directory under your application project&#39;s root.
The routes file is read by the Gulp build process and incorporated into the
application, so there is no need to distribute the routes file with your
application.</p>
<div class="note-info">
<strong>Note</strong> The routes file must define an object, <code>routes</code>, that contains all
application-specific routes. See the example for details and use it as a starting
point.
</div>

<h2 id="defining-a-route">Defining a Route</h2>
<p>Think of each route like a specification for how the data service should
interface with a data source, what arguments to pass to that source, and what to
return from the call. Each route should have a descriptive, unique name. The
route definition is divided into several categories that describe how to execute
the call, keyed by the protocol the data service is using.</p>
<div class="note-tip">
<strong>Best Practice</strong> Using the data service in an application data source is fairly
trivial. However, if you are planning on deploying to different environments that
will use different data sources, think <strong>very</strong> carefully about the format your
application&#39;s data sources will return. To ensure that no platform-specific code
needs to be written in your application, take steps to ensure that your data
sources will return the same type of data in an identical format. (e.g., as an
array, object, or plain text).

<h3 id="-route-return-"><code>Route.return</code></h3>
<p>The data service can return data from a route call in several formats. Depending
on the data protocol, this may automatically transform data into the appropriate
format from the data returned from the call to the route. This may or may not be
allowed, depending on the protocol. See the following table for what return data
types are allowed with which protocols.</p>

<p>Each route also contains a category for each protocol that the route supports

protocols can be safely excluded from the route destination.</p>

<tr>
<td><code>rest.url</code></td>

<td>Array of strings that name the properties to extract from the object passed to the data service call that are to be sent as the REST request query parameters. This will extract and pass them to the REST endpoint in the order defined in the array.</td>

<p><strong>Example REST Properties</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">&quot;rest&quot;: {
   &quot;url&quot;: &quot;/some/endpoint/url&quot;,
   &quot;type&quot;: &quot;GET&quot;,
   &quot;params&quot;: [&quot;someData&quot;],
   &quot;body&quot;: [&quot;moreData&quot;]
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Dynamic URL Generation</strong></p>
<p>The data service also supports dynamic URL generation by substituting keywords in
the configuration URL with the values of properties of the object passed to the
call. The to-be replaced keywords must be prefixed with a <code>$</code> followed by any
valid object property name. The data service will attempt to extract the value of
a parameter contained in the passed object, replacing the keyword with the value.</p>
<p>For example, say that your application made the following call:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">dataApi.call(&quot;uniquelyNamedRoute&quot;, {value: &quot;details&quot;, field: &quot;users&quot;, query: &quot;username&quot;});
</code></pre>
<p>and the route definition was defined as (abridged):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-json">&quot;rest&quot;: {
   &quot;url&quot;: &quot;/get/$value/from/$field&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The data service would then extract the parameters of the object passed to the
call and replace the keywords in the defined URL. In this case, the data service
would construct the following URL and make the request against it:</p>
<pre><code>/get/details/from/users
</code></pre>
<div class="note-warning">
<strong>Important</strong> Be aware that the data service will not pass parameters as query parameters that have been used to replace keywords in the URL. For example, in the above call only the <code>query</code> property would be forwarded to the REST endpoint as a query parameter.
