        <td><p>The bltCounter component is used to collect whole number input from the user. It fulfills the role of the
standard HTML input [number] field with a step interval of 1. An important note is that the ngBoltJS Counter will
always have a value. As soon as this component initializes it will apply a default value to the model attached
to the component if that model is initially (or ever set to a value that is) undefined, non-numeric or violates
the constraints applied to this component. The default value is the closest value to zero that also adheres to
the min and max constraints set on this component.</p>
